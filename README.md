The strategy.

You are probably familiar with the blue badges on Instagram profiles that indicate verification by the social network. While these badges are valuable, they can also be exploited by hackers for social engineering purposes to gain unauthorized access to Instagram accounts. In this scenario, hackers send private messages or emails offering the opportunity to add a verified badge. These messages contain links to deceptive websites that aim to collect your login information. The hackers may even request that you refrain from changing your profile details, such as username or password, until the verification process is complete, giving them enough time to compromise your account. As an example, here is an email scam targeting the owners of Cuddle Buddy, a pillow business.

The resolution.

Additionally, it's worth noting that as of March 2023, Meta has launched a new feature called "Meta Verified" for Instagram and Facebook, similar to the verification process on other social media platforms. If you're interested in subscribing, you can do so through your app or account center, provided you reside in a supported geographic location. You can also join the waitlist and check your eligibility for Meta Verified here.

3. Notifications of questionable, unauthorized behavior.

Strategy.

Cybercriminals who utilize social engineering tactics make use of all the available information they possess. As an illustration, they occasionally create fake warning messages that appear to be genuine notifications from Instagram, but in reality, they include harmful hyperlinks.

The answer.

As per the social platform owned by Meta, Instagram emails are exclusively sent from addresses ending with "@mail. https://help.instagram.com/ " or "@facebookmail. com". Here is an illustration of an authentic security email from Instagram:.

This security notification is regarding a new login from an unfamiliar device. It is important to observe the email address being from a reliable source and the correct alignment of all design components.

If you receive an email that appears to be legitimate, we recommend checking your Instagram account to confirm that the security email was sent through the platform. Additionally, be cautious of fraudulent giveaways and brand sponsorships that may be part of a phishing scam.

The strategy.

Illegitimate giveaways are particularly problematic since they operate within a crowded environment of genuine promotional giveaways. This type of deception can manifest in two distinct forms.

This type of hack, in its traditional form, resembles a false verified badge attack. However, instead of impersonating a verified badge, the hacker pretends to be a well-known brand, an exciting start-up, or a similar reputable company offering a generous giveaway to targeted social media influencers.

In some cases, scammers may go as far as creating seemingly legitimate accounts with a substantial following. The initial message typically contains one or more counterfeit links that lead to a fake Instagram login page designed to trick users into revealing their usernames and passwords.
